# Java - Records, Arrays and JUnit Testing

Used three different implementations for 3x3 and nxn matrices, and created a method to output the matrix raised to a non-zero power, raising exceptions where errors occurred.                                            
Also, created 1800 test cases to test the matrix implementations in JUnit 4.
